Tuffet is a Java API to Couch DB. It allows direct programmatic access to all the features of Couch DB, without any of the necessity of fiddling around with JSON packets. There are a couple of dependencies, which are described below.

BUILDING

To build this software you'll need ant installed.


All dependent libraries are bundled in the lib/ directory. All you need to do after that is type:

ant -f build-release.xml

Once that's finished a jar file will be produced in dist/tuffet.jar.

DEPENDENCIES

There are 3 dependencies for this project:

- Apache HTTP client (version 3.1 or above). This also depends on Apache Commons Codec (1.3+)
- Apache Commons Logging framework (version 1.1 or above)
- Jackson JSON library is also used (0.9.9.3 is what's being used at the moment, this is the most recent version at time of release)

You should find all of these in the lib/ directory
